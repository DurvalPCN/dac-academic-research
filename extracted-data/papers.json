			"abstract": "Research on the teaching of programming has shown that novice programmers often come up against significant difficulties in understanding programming concepts as well as in finding solutions to even elementary programming problems. One of the basic strategies which has been adopted in order to confront this problem, were programming languages and environments created with the specific aim to make both the teaching and learning processes of programming easier. A typical category of these types of environments consists of systems where the novice programmer manipulates real entities such as robots and automatic mechanisms. In this research we present a series of pilot lessons for an introduction to programming with the help of Lego Mindstorms and the visual programming environment ROBOLAB. The research was carried out on Greek secondary school students in the 9th and 10th grades. We present the initial results, which clearly show the advantages of this environment over the standard ones conventionally used, as well as some problems."

These wishes result in questioning educational systems and making innovations in teacher training and education programmes. The teachers and administrators that are going to realize the new understanding have to know themselves what creativity is and how to enhance it (Riza, 1999). In this study, it was tried to learn the perceptions of administrators and teachers as to the concept of creativity and their ideas on enhancing creativity. Original data has been collected with validity and reliability checked data collect instrument improved by Dundar 2003. Original data has analyzed with using statistical methods."

The application adapts to each user dynamically. This is achieved via the systems user model, which relies on stereotypes. The determination of the stereotypes is based on the knowledge level of the learner. The transition of a learner from one stereotype to another one reveals her/ his learning state. In particular, learners are modelled for all possible cognitive states with respect to their progress or non-progress, while they interact with the educational application."

			"abstract": "In October 2004 the University of Lugano in southern Switzerland established a new faculty of informatics. Its founding principles are innovation in teaching and faculty participation in the research community. With respect to teaching, students spend mornings attending lectures and afternoons in an Atelier designed to support interaction both among students and with the instructors. In teaching the first year 'Programming Fundamentals' courses, we took advantage of the clean slate nature of the faculty to introduce innovative teaching elements. The novel aspects include our use of Scheme, Smalltalk, and Java, our combination of individual, pair and group projects and the integration of expert lectures to introduce useful, but slightly orthogonal elements at key points in the semester. Our very positive experience is reported along with a discussion of aspects to improve in the future."

			"abstract": "In this work we present the early design steps of a system for supporting person-centered learning (PCL), focusing on the process of transforming PCL principles into system specifications. Although person centered learning has gained significant attention in higher education, it is not clear how the instructor can be efficiently supported to manage the additional workload emerging from the effort to promote PCL and address individual studentspsila learning traits and preferences. To cope with this issue we argue that specific technology systems can be built for supporting students and instructors in implementing various PCL-related tasks. In our approach we develop a pedagogical model based on common PCL principles, which will be supported by a Web-based system and will be used to help students and teachers in tasks like: identifying learning and teaching preferences, increasing their meta cognitive awareness, defining homogeneous or heterogeneous workgroups and negotiating their preferences."

Individuals who are deaf require visual or signaling system in order to achieve the transmission and reception of ideas. Both mechanisms have been considered in the implementation through the use of graphics that let the student associate ideas with vocabulary, and the use of cued speech as the mechanism of communicating information. This software is not only for helping deaf children to learn about their environment, but also this tool will help with the integration with the rest of the classmates through the teaching of cued speech to both kind of students. Because the software implies pedagogical concepts an extended methodology for developing educational software has been followed, as result of this process is showed through a prototype. This product also had required the interaction between different experts in the fields of Informatics and Pedagogy in order to achieve the purposes of integrating the children to the community, fulfill educational needs, and assure the usability of the software."
